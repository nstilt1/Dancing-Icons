# The-Future-of-OS-Backgrounds
Moving app icons and icons responsive to music. Possible to integrate with the microphone at a concert, or the music that's currently playing. It might drain battery a little, but it looks cool.

I hope that at the very least, tech companies use this feature I have defined. I hope that if they sell this feature as an extension to their OS, that they give me a little kickback and/or a job for shining a light on this feature. But, with the license I have chosen, they can do whatever the hell they want with this idea I have brought forward. It's in the public domain now, so just remember to have fun.

The comments in the code explain how to use the "buttons" that I have laid out, and they also explain another way to make things move. They're more like sliders, but without displaying a value nor having a label.
